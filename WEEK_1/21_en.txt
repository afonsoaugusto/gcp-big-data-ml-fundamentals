It's now time for your lab. You are in charge of migrating your
company's existing machine learning workload for housing recommendations from
your on-premises Hadoop cluster to the Cloud. Your organization is happy with
the current model, but the underlying infrastructure on-premise is causing them
headaches to tune and utilize efficiently. Your CTO wants as little friction
as possible from your existing Hadoop on-premise infrastructure,
but has heard of the advantages that Cloud solutions offer for
autoscaling and serverless management. So here are your lab objectives. Create a Cloud SQL instance and
populate the tables. Explore the rentals data using
SQL statements using Cloud Shell. Launch Dataproc. Train and apply a machine learning model written in
PySpark to create product recommendations. Explore the inserted rows in Cloud SQL. Here's what the setup will look like. In step one, we set up
Google Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL. And then import the records
from GCS into Cloud SQL. And now that your ratings
are in Cloud SQL, in step two, you will run a machine
learning training job in Cloud Dataproc to read those ratings
and train the machine learning model. In step three, you will run the model in
Cloud Dataproc to create recommendations. And save the top five recommendations for
each user back into Cloud SQL. Lastly, step four, your ratings can be delivered
back to users through App Engine. You won't do steps one and four in this lab because those steps
deal mostly with web programming. In this lab, you concentrate
on doing steps two and three. Try out the lab, and keep in mind that you
have multiple attempts for each lab and you can always come back and practice more.
