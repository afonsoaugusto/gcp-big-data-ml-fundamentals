### IoT devices present new challenges to data ingestion

* Data streaming from varios processes or devices
* Distruting event notifications (ex: new user sign up)
* Scale to handle volume
* Reliabe(no duplicates)

## Designing streaming pipelines with Apache Beam - 03_en

* [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/) is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beamâ€™s supported __distributed processing back-ends__, which include Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.
